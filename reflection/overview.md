## **The goal of this project:** To create a program that contains a few games and gives the user options to play whichever games they want to *(The program started off as being a standalone snake game, but my goals evolved from making one game to creating an interface that houses several games.)*

## Features implemented: 
1. Takes in the user's name and displays welcome message.
2. 4 games implemented in one screen with a screenshot of each game in a clickable button (Using tkinter). 
3. If a game tile is clicked, it opens a prompt with instructions.
4. Every game has dark mode/light mode toggle set as the "d" key*.
5. After game ends a prompt asking if the user wants to play again. 

## Stretch goals(Not reached): 
1. To add more games, as well as create a server based multiplayer game. (Not reached) 

## Remarks:
While this program could've been a lot more than it is, and it still can be if more work is put into individual games, I think it was a wonderful learning experience for me. 

#### Known bugs: 
1. *d key does not always work for ticTacToe and spaceInvaders does not have a dark mode implementation.
2. Pong cannot handle oblique ball-paddle collisions and the ball passes straight through the paddle.
